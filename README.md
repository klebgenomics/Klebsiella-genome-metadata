# Klebsiella-genome-metadata

_Klebsiella_ genome metadata scheme, plus guidance, examples and submission template.  
  
This is a community-driven data curation effort to facilitate use and reuse of public genome collections for maximum knowledge gain. These efforts are focussed on _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and closely related organisms in the _K. pneumoniae_ Species Complex (KpSC) and are coordinated by the [KlebNET-GSP](https://klebnet.org/) project team. The data willl be collated and made publically available via this repository and the [PathogenWatch](https://pathogen.watch/) website, which hosts public KpSC genome collections and reports associated genotypes.
  
Our goal is to collect information with broad utility to research focussed on KpSC, and that can be readily harmonised for easy and effective reuse.

The scheme includes two types of data fields:  
  
**1. Isolate metadata** fields capture information about the individual KpSC isolates and their associated genome sequences, as well as the sample sources and/or hosts from which the isolates were collected.  
  
**2. Sampling** fields capture information about how and why isolates were collected and/or chosen for sequencing. These data are essential to understand the underlying biases in genome collections, and to make descisions about the inclusion or exclusion of isolates for comparative and aggregate analyses.

The submission template is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B1G6akgdNItXsk85QsX3TZvumM1ROZZfYnt-h3FzUoA/edit?usp=sharing). Detailed instructions and guidance for data submission can be found below.

## Data submission

The data submission template is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B1G6akgdNItXsk85QsX3TZvumM1ROZZfYnt-h3FzUoA/edit?usp=sharing). Please **MAKE A COPY** to add your own data. You cannot enter data directly into the master copy of the template. Once completed, email or share your copy to klebsiella.genome.metadata@gmail.com.

The full list of data fields, value formats and options are shown in the tables below. 

#### Fields with restricted vocabularies
Some fields have restricted vocabularies and/or require selection from a list of predefined data values. In most cases the list of possible values can be accessed and searched via a drop-down list within the submission template (also shown in the tables below, marked 'Choose from list') and only values matching those in the list will be accepted. However, in a minority of cases the possible set of values is derived from an established ontology that is too large for inclusion within the submission template. These fields are marked as, 'Controlled vocabulary,' with a link to the appropriate ontology e.g. NCBI taxonomy database or MeSH disease ontology.

#### Fields with a list of suggested values
In some cases it is desirable to have a restricted vocabulary to support data harmonisation, but there are no appropriate predefined ontologies and too many foreseeable options to create a definitive list. In these cases, we provide a list of suggested values that we expect to capture the vast majority of scenarios, but also provide the option to enter alternative values via free text. These fields are marked in the tables below as 'Choose common values from the list, or if none are appropriate, enter free text'. The submission template includes a drop-down list of the suggested values, but will allow other values to be entered (these free text entries will be marked with warnings).

## Isolate metadata

These data describe individual bacterial isolates and their associated sequence data. Please complete one row per isolate.  

Variable fields, and guidance for completing them, are shown in the table below.

For text fields, please **DO NOT** enter 'Unknown' or 'missing' etc, just leave the field blank if you don't have any data to input.

## Sampling fields

These contextual data describe the purpose of sampling, and the sampling strategy for the collection from which each isolate is derived. Please complete one row per isolate.  

Variable fields, and guidance for completing them, are summarised in the table below. [Definitions](#term-definitions-for-purpose-of-sampling) and [detailed examples](#examples-of-how-to-describe-study-designs-using-the-sampling-fields) are also shown below the table.

### Term definitions for purpose-of-sampling

#### Routine diagnostics and / or infection control
Samples collected through the **routine** and **ongoing** activities of clinical or veterinary microbiology laboratories for the purposes of **clinical diagnosis and/or infection control**. May include isolates confirmed as infecting agents and/or those considered as asymptomatic or environmental colonisers e.g. isolates identified from hospital sinks or patient screening swabs as part of routine infection prevention and control procedures.
 
#### Routine surveillance
Samples collected through the **routine** and **ongoing** activities of other laboratories (not clinical or veterinary microbiology laboratories) and/or collected **for purposes other than clinical diagnostics and infection control** e.g. laboratories processing samples from non-healthcare environmental sources or food products. 
 
#### Outbreak investigation / outbreak-initiated surveillance
Samples collected as part of a **response to a specific outbreak** e.g. within a hospital or other healthcare setting (human or veterinary). May include isolates confirmed as infecting agents and/or those considered as asymptomatic colonisers (e.g. from screening swabs) and/or those from environmental sources (e.g. hospital sinks, drains etc.)
 
#### Research
Samples collected for **specific research** purposes (excluding outbreak investigation / outbreak-initiated surveillance) that would **not have otherwise been collected** via routine diagnostics, infection control or surveillance activities as described above.

### Examples of how to describe study designs using the sampling fields

Below we describe various hypothetical study designs and show how the **sampling** fields would be populated for each.

#### Neonatal sepsis study
_K. pneumoniae_ were isolated from the blood of neonates via routine diagnostic procedures. All isolates collected between 1 Jan 2019 and 31 Dec 2020 were stocked and subjected to whole genome sequencing.

</p>
  
#### Ceftriaxone-resistant infection study
_K. pneumoniae_ identified via routine diagnostic procedures from hospitalised patients in a tertiary care centre between February 2016 and February 2018 were collected. Isolates resistant to ceftriaxone were selected for sequencing.

</p>
  
#### CPE outbreak study
In May 2019 there was a sudden increase in CPE infections in the ICU of a large tertiary care centre. Enhanced infection prevention and control procedures were activated from 18 May until 31 August when the outbreak was declared contained: rectal screening swabs were collected on patient admission and every 3 days thereafter, in addition to sink and drain screening swabs. All swabs were cultured on selective media and presumptive carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ were sequenced alongside all carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ identified from ICU patients via routine diagnostics procedures.

</p>
  
#### CR-hvKp study
Carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ were isolated from liver abscess patients as part of a reserach study focussed on diabetic patients, between 1 June 2018 and 30 June 2020. Strains carrying _K. pneumoniae_ carbapanemase genes were detected by PCR and string test was used to determine hypermucoidy. String test positive isolates harbouring _bla_<sub>KPC</sub> were subjected to whole genome sequencing.

</p>
  
#### Pig gut carriage study
Veterinary researchers collected 100 faecal samples from each of six pig farms in June 2017. _K. pneumoniae_ were isolated by culture on SCAI media and subjected to whole genome sequencing as part of a One Health research project.

</p>

(Note that the specific hosts, ie pigs, should be indicated in the isolate metadata field 'host', rather than in the sampling field)

  
#### Water surveillance study
_K. pneumoniae_ were isolated from fresh and wastewaters in a metropolitan centre as part of routine water surveillance conducted by the Environmental Protection Authority. Since 2021 all isolates have been stocked and 100 isolates have been randomly selected for sequencing each year. Sampling and sequencing is ongoing.
