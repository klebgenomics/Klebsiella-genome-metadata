# Klebsiella-genome-metadata

Resources supporting a community-driven data curation effort to facilitate use and reuse of public genome collections for maximum knowledge gain. These efforts are focussed on _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and closely related organisms in the _K. pneumoniae_ Species Complex (KpSC) and are coordinated by the [KlebNET-GSP](https://klebnet.org/) project team. The data willl be collated and made publicaly available via this repository and the [PathogRenWatch](https://pathogen.watch/) website, which hosts public KpSC genome collections and reports associated genotypes.

The scheme includes two types of data fields:  
**1. Isolate meta-data** fields capture information about the individual KpSC isolates and their associated genome sequences, as well as the sample sources and/or hosts from which the isolates were collected.  
**2. Purpose of sampling** fields capture information about how and why isolates were collected and/or chosen for sequencing. These data are essential to understand the underlying biases in genome collections and to make descisions about the inclusion or exclusion of isolates for comparative and aggregate analyses.

The submission template is available here. Detailed instructions and guidance for data submssion can be found below.

## Data submission

TBC. 

The data submission template is available here. Please DO NOT enter data directly into this version. Please MAKE A COPY to add your own data.  


## Isolate metadata fields

Data entries describe individual bacterial isolates and their associated sequence data. Please complete one row per isolate.  

Data fields and guidance are shown in the table below.

## Purpose of sampling

Data entries describe the purpose of sampling and the sampling strategy for the collection from which the isolate is derived. Please complete one row per isolate.  

Data fields and guidance are summarised in the table. Definitions and detailed examples are shown below.  


### Purpose of sampling definitions

#### Routine diagnostics and / or infection control
Samples collected through the **routine** and **ongoing** activities of clinical or veterinary microbiology laboratories for the purposes of **clinical diagnosis and/or infection control**. May include isolates confirmed as infecting agents and/or those considered as asymptomatic or environmental colonisers e.g. isolates identified from hospital sinks or patient screening swabs as part of routine infection prevention and control procedures.
 
#### Routine surveillance
Samples collected through the **routine** and **ongoing** activities of other laboratories (not clinical or veterinary microbiology laboratories) and/or collected **for purposes other than clinical diagnostics and infection control** e.g. laboratories processing samples from non-healthcare environmental sources or food products. 
 
#### Outbreak investigation / outbreak-initiated surveillance
Samples collected as part of a **response to a specific outbreak** e.g. within a hospital or other healthcare setting (human or veterinary). May include isolates confirmed as infecting agents and/or those considered as asymptomatic colonisers (e.g. from screening swabs) and/or those from environmental sources (e.g. hospital sinks, drains etc.)
 
#### Research
Samples collected for **specific research** purposes (excluding outbreak investigation / outbreak-initiated surveillance) that would **not have otherwise been collected** via routine diagnostics, infection control or surveillance activities as described above.
